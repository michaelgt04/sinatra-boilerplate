# Getting Started
Run the following commands to get started!

`bundle install`
`ruby server.rb`

This application gives you a basic Sinatra app to get started on a side project.
You have a simple `GET` at the index route to serve as the homepage. From there,
feel free to add more views and ERB templates to make the application do what you'd
like it to do. Also be sure to change the `<title>` tag in the `layout.erb` file to
the actual title of your app.

A CSS stylesheet has already been hooked up to the app so you can add styling. It's
located in the public folder. A JavaScript file has also been linked to the
application as well so that you can add JS code to any of your pages. It is also
located in the public folder.
